# Government of Canada Digital Standards

## 1. Work in the Open by Default
Share evidence, research, and decision-making openly. Make all non-sensitive data, information, and new code developed in the delivery of services open to the outside world for sharing and reuse under an open licence.

## 2. Empower Staff to Deliver Better Services
Ensure staff have access to the tools, training, and technologies they need. Empower the team to make decisions throughout the design, build, and operation of the service.

## 3. Design with Users
Research with users to understand their needs and the problems we want to solve. Conduct ongoing testing with users to guide design and development.

## 4. Iterate and Improve Frequently
Develop services using agile, iterative, and user-centred methods. Continuously improve in response to user needs. Try new things, start small, and scale up.

## 5. Build in Accessibility from the Start
Services should meet or exceed accessibility standards. Engage users with distinct needs from the outset to ensure what is delivered will work for everyone.

## 6. Be Good Data Stewards
Collect data from users only once and reuse wherever possible. Ensure that data is collected and held securely so it can be reused by others to provide services.

## 7. Collaborate Widely
Create multidisciplinary teams with the range of skills needed to deliver a common goal. Share and collaborate in the open. Create partnerships that help deliver value to users.

## 8. Use Open Standards and Solutions
Leverage open standards and embrace leading practices, including the use of open source software where appropriate. Design seamless services across devices and channels.

## 9. Design Ethical Services
Ensure everyone receives fair treatment. Follow ethical guidelines in the design and use of systems, especially in automated decision-making (e.g. AI).

## 10. Address Security and Privacy Risks
Take a balanced approach to managing risk with appropriate privacy and security measures. Ensure security measures are frictionless and do not burden users.
